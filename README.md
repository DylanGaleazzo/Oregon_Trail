CS225 Oregon Trail Group Project

In order to use github with visual studio, this will need to be downloaded.
https://visualstudio.github.com/

This project is on Visual Studio 2019 so it probably won't work with 2017. It definitely won't work on the school computers.

Just click the green button that says "clone or download" and select "open with visual studio". All the files should be there. 

When you are writing code, make sure to commit all changes, then push or sync all your changes before you fetch the new ones.
