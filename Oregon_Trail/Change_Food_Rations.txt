	Change food rations

The amount of food the people in 
your party eat each day can 
change. These amounts are:

   1. bare bones - meals are very 
      small; everyone stays hungry.

   2. meager - meals are small, but
      adequate.

   3. filling - meals are large and
      generous.

What is your choice?
